Environmental Monitoring System for Aerospace/Astronautics Missions

Essential Climate Logging, Integration & Processing for Space Environments. 
I'm building a system using C++ that uses a variety of sensors to record environemntal measurements, log them and alert the user if any of the readings are abnormal. 

This project is for my final year project and I will be writing a thesis at a later date.
